; This is the config used by Max when instantiating the JVM ;
; Comments are enclosed within 2 semicolons ;

; The file format is relatively fragile so pay attention ;
; when editing this file !! ;
 
; some example options one may use ;

; add all jars in /Users/topher/java/lib to the system classpath i.e. immutable classpath ;
; max.system.jar.dir /Users/topher/java/lib;

; add /Users/topher/foo to the system classpath i.e. immutable classpath ;
; max.system.class.dir /Users/topher/foo      ;

; these next 2 are typically what you would want to use if you want additional directories ;
; added to your classpath for max ;

; add /Users/topher/myclasses to the dynamic classpath of MXJClassLoader ;
; max.dynamic.class.dir /Users/topher/myclasses ;

; add all jars in /Users/topher/myjars to the dynamic classpath of MXJClassLoader ;
;max.dynamic.jar.dir /Users/topher/myjars     ;


; specify some jvm options ;
max.jvm.option -Xincgc
max.jvm.option -Xms256m
max.jvm.option -Xmx1g

; uncomment these options(i.e. remove surrounding semi colons ;
; to cause the JVM to be created ;
; in debug mode and listening for remote debugger connections ;
; on port 8074. This would enable you to interactively debug ;
; your mxj code using JDB or some other debugger which supports ;
; the JDI wire protocol ;

max.jvm.option -Xdebug  ;
max.jvm.option -Xnoagent ;
max.jvm.option -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket\,address=8074\,server=y\,suspend=n ; 
max.jvm.option -XX:-UseSharedSpaces ;

; 1 = compatible mode (default in 64bit) ;
; 2 = hi performance mode (default in 32bit) ;
; hi performance mode for 64 bit is only supported with a JavaVM > 6u33 (where -XX:+UseCompressedOops is default) ;
; mxj.msp.mode 2 ;
